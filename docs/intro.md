# The Reddit Bot?

We have all seen those Text To Speech videos on YouTube and TikTok, right? A Minecraft background, screenshots from a random Reddit thread, and TTS. Well, those low-effort videos can be completely automated now! Using this bot, you can produce a high-quality video (perfect for your TikTok and YouTube) in 5 to 10 minutes with almost no effort.

Before we start, though, there is an installation script that installs everything from scratch that you can use if you are on MacOS or Linux (I would strongly recommend using it):

`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/master/install.sh)`

All the credit for this bot's development goes to Lewis Menelaws. Get in touch with Lewis and his server filled with a bunch of lovely developers [here](https://discord.gg/5uw4eCQf6Z). Check out the project on Github (and maybe leave a star on it), [by clicking here](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot).

This simple documentation will guide you through the installation process of the bot & its required source files and get you running in no time!
