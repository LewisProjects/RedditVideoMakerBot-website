# Prerequisites
## Python
First of all, check if you have Python 3.10 already installed by running `python --version` in the terminal. You can open the terminal on Windows by typing 'CMD' in your Windows search. 

<details>
<summary>It returns something like 'Python 3.10.x'</summary>
You've already set up Python, good job! You can skip to the <a href="/docs/downloading-the-bot">next section</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>It returns something like 'Python 3.9.x' or 'Python 3.11.x'</summary>
Unfortunately you have a wrong version of Python installed. You can either update or downgrade your Python version to 3.10. Here is a short video on how to <a href="https://youtu.be/6pKeMH4z1aU">update Python</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>It can't find Python</summary>
If it says something like this, then you need to install Python:

```shell
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

```shell
python: command not found
```
Read further on this page because we're going to install Python now.

### Installing python on Windows
The easiest way to install Python on Windows is to use the Microsoft Store. You can find it [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).

If your Microsoft Store does not work, you can download Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe).

When you install Python this way, you will see a checkbox at the bottom which says _Add Python 3.10.x to PATH._ **Make sure you check this box. It is extremely** **crucial!**

<details>
<summary>Once you're finished</summary>
You can check if Python is installed by running <code>python --version</code> in the terminal. You can open the terminal on Windows by typing 'CMD' in your Windows search. If it returns something like 'Python 3.10.x', you're good to go! You can now go to the next section.
