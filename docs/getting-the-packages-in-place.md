# Getting the packages in place

## Windows

### If you downloaded the zip:

Head over to the folder where all the files are stored. Once you are there, you should see a bar at the top showing the directory's path. Double click that:

![path](<.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Once you double-click it, type `cmd` and press enter. You should see a _Command Prompt_ window pop up that is placed inside your source folder.

![cmd](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Once in, type: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Word to word! Again, make sure you are in the directory. Give it a few minutes and let it download the packages.\
Once done, you should be seeing something like this:

![pip](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

### If you cloned the repo

In the place where you initially cloned the repo, type this command:

```shell
cd redditvideomakerbot
```

You can now run:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
