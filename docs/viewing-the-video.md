# Viewing the video

If you want to watch a video in a clean UI, open the cmd and execute this command: `python GUI.py` (or `python3 GUI.py`). It will bring you to a new page in your browser to help you view the videos. If you want to publish them to platforms like TikTok or Youtube Shorts, then in the project folder, there is a new `Results` folder. That's where you can get the final mp4 video.

Open that folder. There should be a video the bot has just made for you with the same name as the Reddit post's title, e.g., `What is something that gets all the hate that it deserves`? (This applies as of update 2.3).

**Please do not delete any clips/videos. The bot automatically deletes them when you run it again and replaces them with the new ones**.
