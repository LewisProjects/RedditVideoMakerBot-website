# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I easily edit the config file?

Run `python GUI.py` this opens a web editor in which you can edit the config file. You can also preview the TTS voices.

## How can I make the bot read the post description, not the comments?

The bot by default will only read the title of the post. If you want to read the post description, you can change the `story_mode` option in the `config.toml` file to `true`. Method 0 is one screenshot of the whole text. We recommend method 1, which is a fancy image for every sentence.

## How can I listen to the TTS voices?
