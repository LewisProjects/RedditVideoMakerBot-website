# Downloading the Bot

**To download the bot, you can click this link** [**Master Branch Download**](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

**To view the source code of the master branch, you can visit** [**The Bot Github**](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot)

**To download the Develop Branch, click this link** [**Develop Branch Download**](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip)

**(Note that the develop branch is not stable. Use it at your own risk)**

You can also **clone the repo**:

Using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot.git
```

Using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot
```

There will be a new directory in your current working directory called `RedditVideoMakerBot`.

Use **Github Desktop:**

![GD](<.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

The repo will appear in your GitHub desktop app.

Or **download the zip** (the same as using the downloads at the top of this page).

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

The download should start (on Firefox and similar browsers, you may need to confirm the download). Files should be in your preferred location.

Once done, unzip the files. <--- This applies to the download links at the top of this page as well.
